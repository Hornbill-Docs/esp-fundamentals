# Software Updates
Hornbill streamlines the software update process for its customers by removing the traditional challenges associated with updating enterprise software systems. By maintaining all software updates in the background, Hornbill ensures that its customers always have access to the latest features and enhancements without any disruption to their customizations and integrations. This seamless approach allows organizations to focus on their core business activities while benefiting from the continuous improvements provided by Hornbill.

## Continuous Delivery
Software updates in Hornbill's continuous delivery model refer to the regular and incremental enhancements made to the software, which are automatically provided to users without any need for manual intervention. This model enables Hornbill to deliver new features, improvements, bug fixes, and security patches to customers seamlessly and with minimal disruption.

Here's an explanation of the key aspects of software updates for Hornbill's SaaS continuous delivery model:

- __Frequent updates__: In Hornbill's continuous delivery model, updates are released more frequently than in traditional software development models. This approach ensures that users always have access to the latest features and improvements, without having to wait for major version upgrades.

- __Incremental improvements__: Updates in Hornbill's continuous delivery model often involve small, incremental changes, which allow developers to identify and address issues more quickly. This helps maintain a high level of software quality and reduces the risk of introducing significant problems with each update.

- __Automatic updates__: In Hornbill's SaaS environment, updates are delivered automatically, without requiring any action from the user. This eliminates the need for manual updates and reduces the likelihood of users running outdated or vulnerable software.

- __Zero downtime__: Hornbill strives to implement updates with minimal or zero downtime, ensuring that users can continue to access and use the software throughout the update process. This is achieved through strategies such as rolling updates, where the software is updated in stages, and blue-green deployments, where two versions of the application run simultaneously, and users are seamlessly switched to the updated version once it's ready.

- __Continuous feedback loop__: Hornbill's continuous delivery model enables a feedback loop between users and developers. As users interact with the software, they can provide feedback on issues or suggest improvements, which can then be rapidly incorporated into future updates. This fosters a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation.

- __Enhanced security__: Hornbill can quickly address security vulnerabilities and deploy patches to protect its customers. The continuous delivery model ensures that security updates are applied promptly, reducing the risk of security breaches and protecting user data.

Overall, software updates in Hornbill's SaaS continuous delivery model provide users with an up-to-date, secure, and high-quality software experience, while allowing developers to respond quickly to user feedback and changing market demands.

Here's a description of how Hornbill makes its roadmaps available in its software:

- __In-app access__: Hornbill provides a dedicated section within its software where users can view and explore the roadmaps. This allows users to quickly access information about upcoming features and improvements without needing to search external websites or request information from support teams.

- __Feature categorization__: The roadmaps in Hornbill's software are organized into categories, which can include new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and more. This categorization helps users easily identify the updates that are most relevant to their needs and understand the overall direction of the product.

- __Status updates__: Hornbill's roadmaps include status indicators for each item, such as "Planned," "In Progress," or "Completed." These indicators help users track the progress of specific features and improvements and give them an idea of when to expect these updates in the software.

- __Release timeframes__: Where possible, Hornbill includes estimated release timeframes for its roadmap items. This information helps users plan for the integration of new features and improvements into their workflows and allows them to anticipate any necessary adjustments.

- __Feedback and collaboration__: Hornbill encourages users to provide feedback on its roadmaps and suggest new features or improvements via its [community forums](https://community.hornbill.com). This collaborative approach helps Hornbill better understand the needs and priorities of its users and ensures that the software continues to evolve in a way that meets their requirements.

By making its roadmaps available directly within our software, we wish to foster a sense of transparency and trust with our customers. This approach keeps customers informed about the ongoing development of the software and enables them to plan more effectively for the future.
