# Hornbill Roadmap

Hornbill encompasses a complex ecosystem involving various components, including the core platform, integration libraries for cloud and IT operations, and a range of business applications available in the Hornbill App Store. The platform, as well as each of these application are developed/maintained by dedicated teams, ensuring the right subject matter expertise is applied to each application. This decentralized approach to development ensures that each component can evolve independently.

Creating a unified roadmap for the entire Hornbill ecosystem would be impractical. Such a document would amalgamate the development timelines and updates of the platform itself, the cloud and IT operational integration libraries, the IT Operations Management (ITOM) integrations, the ITOM product suite, and the individual applications offered in the App Store. Given the distinct development cycles, team responsibilities, and the detailed nature of updates each component undergoes, a singular roadmap would likely become overly complex and challenging to navigate for stakeholders (both internal and for our customers).

To address this complexity, Hornbill has adopted a more granular approach to its roadmap publications. By organizing the roadmaps by product, Hornbill ensures that information is accessible and understandable, with each product/application roadmap having specific focus.  Customers can easily find specific roadmaps relevant to their interests or usage within the ecosystem. This organization aids in setting clear expectations regarding new features, updates, and enhancements for each component/application of the Hornbill platform.

For customers, accessing these published roadmaps is made easy within the Hornbill platform itself. The Hornbill Solution Center serves as a hub where customers can navigate to the "Subscription" section and then to the "Roadmap Library." This library offers an organized collection of roadmaps, allowing customers to stay informed about the developmental trajectory of the components they utilize. This transparency fosters a deeper understanding of Hornbill's commitment to innovation and customer support, ensuring users can anticipate changes and plan accordingly.

## Roadmaps

Each roadmap is presented as a visual Kanban-inspired board containing a fixed set of columns, each column has a specific meaning, allowing you to understand what features and changes are accepted for development, and in what stage of development each feature is at.

## Roadmap Timelines for Feature Development
Outside of being generally asked for "a roadmap" this question is almost always followed by a question seeking timelines in order to answer to the "when will I get the things I asked for?" and as is the case for almost every serious software company, there is never a simple answer to that question.  The official position is, we never apply, and advise our customers __NOT__ to expect, any service-level commitments on product feature/enhancement requests.  Of course, with our Customer-First value held close to our hearts, we do our best to include as much, and as quickly as we  can.  Hornbill is a broadly scoped solution, with complex and deep capabilities serving a wide range of customers needs.  

Technology and Security landscapes are moving targets that we have to continuously adapt to, we have strategic, commercial and competitive imperatives that we must meet, security posture evolution and  continuous improvements in reliability and scalability, and as well as those considerations, we have to deliver as much as we can in terns of individual customer needs too.   

Times between releases can be anything from days to months, depending on what we are doing, although we aim to keep release cycles for each product/applications as small as possible, once a week is a typical release cadence we prefer.  So the answer to the question, how long does it take to get my feature in the product is really "as soon as we can, given all of our other priorities".  Ultimately, if you have a "business critical" need for something that is not in the product, then you should speak to us and we *might* be able to help, but in all honestly, we do not allow individual customer needs re-prioritize our roadmaps because it would be irresponsible and unfair on other customers to do so, so we are likely to respond with something along the lines of "in that case, perhaps Hornbill is not fit for purpose for your needs at this time". 

## Roadmap Inclusion Policy

### Purpose
This Roadmap Inclusion Policy outlines the criteria, processes, and guidelines for including features, enhancements, and significant bug fixes in our product roadmaps. Our aim is to ensure a transparent, collaborative, and strategic approach to product development that aligns with our company’s vision, customer needs, and market trends.

### Scope
This policy applies to all products and services developed and maintained by our company. It covers the inclusion of new features, enhancements to existing features, and significant bug fixes in the product roadmaps.

### Criteria for Inclusion
1. __Strategic Alignment:__ The proposed item must align with the overall strategic goals of the company and the product’s vision.
1. __Customer Value/Impact:__ The item should have a demonstrable impact on improving customers general satisfaction, solving customers pain points, or delivering customers value, determined in the context of customers collectively, not individually.
1. __Non-Prescriptive:__ The item should not prescribe a specific function, but should be expressed as an enhancement/addition in business value terms. 
1. __Market Trends:__ Consideration of emerging market trends and technologies that could enhance the value we deliver to our customers and give us a competitive edge.
1. __Feasibility:__ Assessment of the technical, resource, and time feasibility of implementing the proposed item in the context of the overall solution.
1. __Regulatory and Compliance Needs:__ Ensuring the product complies with relevant laws, regulations, and standards required by our customers as well as our own quality standards.
1. __Security and Privacy:__ Enhancements that improve the security and privacy posture of our product.


### Process for Inclusion
1. __Starting with a Discussion:__ One of the most important steps to adding an item to our roadmap is getting to the point of __Complete Understanding__ of the requirement. ensuring that requirement is fully aligned with our roadmap, general direction and Criteria for Inclusion. Internally originated items that are included in the roadmap for development would come out of numerous internal conversations, meetings, working groups as well as furthering our strategic and maturity needs.  For external enhancement requests, we have a very specific process we follow... please see [Asking for Enhancements To Be Included in the Hornbill Roadmap](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#asking-for-enhancements-to-be-included-in-the-hornbill-roadmap)
1. __Review and Prioritization:__ The Product Management team will review submissions based on the above criteria. Items will be prioritized based on strategic importance, customer impact, and resource availability.
1. __Stakeholder Feedback:__ Shortlisted items will be shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback and further validation.
1. __Approval and Scheduling:__ The Product Steering Committee will make final decisions on the inclusion and scheduling of roadmap items.
1. __Communication:__ Approved roadmap items will be communicated to all stakeholders, including teams and customers, through appropriate channels, adding these items where needed to the __Incoming__ lane in the appropriate roadmap. 

### Updating Hornbill Roadmaps
Roadmaps are dynamic documents that will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect progress, changing priorities, and new insights.  You can view our published Roadmaps at any time to see the latest development activity that applies. 

### Feedback and Suggestions
We encourage feedback and suggestions from all stakeholders to continuously improve our roadmap planning and execution process. Internal stakeholders will always use our internal workspaces, while customers should always use our community forums to submit feedback, suggestions, ideas and product enhancement related questions.

### Governance
This policy is governed by the Product Management team and is subject to periodic review and updates to ensure it remains relevant and effective in guiding our roadmap planning and development processes.


## Asking for Enhancements To Be Included in the Hornbill Roadmap
Every customer originated enhancement request starts with a discussion. Sometimes, simple enhancement requests are self-evident, for example, a request for something like "would it be possible to add a keyboard shortcut to invoke the print command" would hardly require a discussion at all.  However, in practice, enhancement requests are rarely that straightforward and tend to be nuanced in some way. Each customers use of Hornbill is different, because each customers organization has unique (to them) ways of working and using Hornbill to support that work.   Hornbill's products are very customizable, so for the most part, tailoring can be done by a customer to meet their specific needs.  However, sometimes this is not the case and more is required. 

For the avoidance of any doubt, any discussion that leads to an enhancement request would lead to a clear and well documented (in the discussion) definition of what the requirement is, almost certainly summarized by one of Hornbill's product team clarifying what has been understood as the requirement.  This is what would constitute a discussion with clear outcome that leads to a product enhancement request. 

It might be that a particular part of our solution is not customizable at all, or not customizable enough to meet a specific need, or, it might be that there is a function that does not even exist, that should, or could be added to make the product more useful/valuable to a customer to help a specific use case.  On our experience, customers will generally (and rightly) think about solving problems or improving efficiency/workflows in the context of their own organization, and more often than not, what makes sense in one context, does not always make sense in another context.

In order to understand what is being asked for, this often means getting a more thorough understanding of how a customers *specific* scenario applies to whats being asked, and then, once we understand that customers need, and the value any change would add, Hornbill's product team(s) then need to re-imagine that change, but in the context of our strategic roadmap, overall use case and the generally understood landscape of how our product is used collectively. 

It is also important not to be prescriptive in your request. By this we mean, if you just ask for a widget X or function Y, or button Z, or API 1 etc, that may well be meaningful to you, and meet a need you have, but we will likely not understand that need, and so are very unlikely to progress that request, or even respond to it.  We always seek to understand the business value, and if the business requirement (aka what you are trying to achieve/what business outcome you expect from the product change) is not the core foundation of the question, then its difficult to asses the request against our [Criteria For Inclusion](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#criteria-for-inclusion) and therefore would not be considered for inclusion.  When asking for an enhancement please make sure you first express the enhancement in terms of business need and business outcome, and, if you want to you can also include a suggestion as to specifically what you might change to achieve that. Doing this helps us better understand the need, and opens the possibility that we might be able to suggest an alternative or even better way to achieve the same outcome.


### Managing Customer Requests/Asks and Expectations
The first thing to say is, outside very exceptional circumstances where it would be inappropriate to do so (for example if there are security concerns or real commercial sensitivity for a specific organization), we *ONLY* accept feature requests via our community forums.  That is, if you would like to see a change to the product, the starting point is to "raise it on the forums".  It is not uncommon for a customer to ask their account exec in an account review meeting for enhancements, but we will always respond with, please ask that question on the forum.   The reason for this is, we do not not track internal requests for change that have not been committed to a roadmap, in fact we specifically and purposefully do not just log one-liner enhancement requests, simply because doing so simply creates a huge list of one-liner feature requests that no body understands, and essentially ends up being one big undeliverable backlog of items.  

Instead, we take each and every enhancement request as a discussion, this affords us a number of things..

- Our forums are connected to our internal workspaces, so, if you ask a question on, for example, the Hornbill ESP Platform forum, your post will be relayed to an internal Hornbill workspace and *all* developers, product stakeholders, support, consultants and others will most likely get sight of, and be generally aware of the question you have asked. 
- By posting your question on the forum, we now have a connected communication channel between you directly and our internal product folks, allowing anyone in Hornbill that needs to, additional questions, clarifications, suggestions, or even feedback that this is not something we would consider. 
- By posting your question on our public forums, all other customers who have interest in the area of the product you are asking about will also see your question, they may have other ideas, contribution or even offer support for the thing you are asking for. 
- Because we relay these questions into our internal workspaces there is a very good chance this will trigger some internal conversations, and will almost always trigger some kind of response back on the forum, that might be seeking more information, or trying to garner a better understanding of whats being asked for, might include one or more suggestions as to how you might achieve the outcome you want in an alternative way, or could even be a flat, No, we would not add that. 

Sometimes though, you should keep in mind that you may not get any response from Hornbill, we do not offer SLA commitments on enhancement requests, but despite that, if you feel something should be added to the product, you should ask anyway, even if you do not see a response, you are raising awareness of your requirement, of the suggestion and that will be seen by our engineers and product people.  Sometimes ideas and suggestions are really good, but the timing for inclusion is off, it can be as simple as that.  

We will always do our best to respond to every request, but we are not perfect and things do get missed, so if that does happen, as long as you are reasonable about it, pleas feel free to bump it every now and then if you have not seen any response in a couple of weeks or more. 

### Things you can do to improve the chances of getting your feature request included
It is possible to improve the chances of getting a response, and even getting your requested feature included in the product.  These include: =

__Timing:__ For example, if we are doing a lot of, say, email related changes, and you ask for something email related, the email system is currently top-of-mind with the developers so your ask might naturally just drop into that. 

__Specificity:__ The more specific you are, and the easier your request is to get into the head space of the product people/developers at Hornbill, the more likely your request will make it through. We are all bust people, and as we mentioned before, it can be a lot of work/time mentally to translate a requirement for a customer-specific scenario into a viable piece of code.  So if the nature of your ask is very specific and self-evident, then its likely to be easily understood by our developers, will not need *translating* by a business analyst and so on, and when that happens, so long as it meets the other criteria in our [Criteria for Inclusion](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#criteria-for-inclusion) then this is likely to make it quite quickly.

__Generalized:__ The more generalized the function, the more it will deliver against the '''Customer Value/Impact''' for customers in the general, the higher the likelihood for inclusion.  Conversely, if your requirement is highly specific to your organization, but you can meet that need buy asking for a more Generalized customization capability that would help your specific need, and if that more generalized customization capability would be generally useful to customers overall, then that would help move things forwards. 

__Strategic Alignment:__ We are generally moving towards our strategic product goals, primarily driven by the competitive landscape within which we operated, and the aspirations we have in the marketplace.  Anything you ask for that is aligned with those goals are obviously more likely to make it into the product. 

__Work With Us:__ Being a commercial organizations who's success is only possible when our customers are successful, we will consider any request in any form, but we still need to get a full understanding of what you need, and we still need to engage our developers and product people in understanding you requirements. The more you can work with us, help us get that understanding, be specific, answer questions, be willing to engage with us in the way that works for us, the more likely we are able to be able to accommodate your needs. Remember, its in our very best interests to satisfy our customers in every way we can, and we also recognize that we do not know everything, and know our customers are vastly more practiced in their business operations that we could ever be, and recognize the value in that expertise.  We want to engage, learn from you and improve our product so you can draw more value from it, its in our commercial interests to ensure we do this as much as possible. 

## Roadmap Frequently Asked Questions

__I have asked for something to be added to the product on the forum and no one has answered me?__
> We do not commit to any specific service-level agreements for product enhancement requests. You should be aware that, even if you do not get a response, by asking the question you will have definitely raised some awareness of your requirement internally at Hornbill, as we collectively see everything, these things do not go unnoticed. Try to follow the guidance above to improve the livlihood of getting a response and/or getting your ask included.  If your issue remains unanswered and you feel its business critical, then please talk to your account manager, we may need to recognize that Hornbill is not able to meet your specific critical business needs at this time. 

__Why is there no movement in the roadmap items?__
> The the latest roadmap for respective products are distributed to your instance each time the product or application is released to the 'live' stream.  Its possible for the delivery of features to be one release out of sync, simply to do with a combination of timing and general roadmap content management.  The roadmap will give you a good insight as to whats coming, and whats already been delivered.  The timestamps on the card indicate the date/time the card makes it into the lane its currently present in

__I Noticed that a card appeared in the Complete column which I have never seen before?__
> This is more than possible, because its not a requirement that each request starts on the left Incoming lane and works its way through each lane.  It is very comment, that, as we are developing our strategic roadmap, or addressing usability issues, security issues or other unplanned changes, that lead to items that we consider "__roadmap noteworthy__", then we will add a card to the roadmap, implement it, and move it to completed before the next release of that product/application.  This is not an uncommon thing to happen.  What is important though, is, all "__roadmap noteworthy__" changes will make it into the Completed column, so you can see what has been delivered.  

__I am a big and important customer and I *WANT* my changes added - can I force you to add things to the product?__
> Hornbill is ultimately a commercial organization so in practical terms, the amount of spend will always have some bearing on our decision making process. The truth is, larger customers are more mature, and their experience can lead to better product maturity, which in turn can lead to smaller organizations/teams benefitting also. All that being said, we will generally not allow, even our largest customers impose changes to our product strategy, unless that change more generally serves interests of our customers collectively.

__I have plenty of money to spend and want to pay Hornbill to do specific development work to get me what I need - will you accommodate my requirements?__
> Hornbill is ultimately a commercial organization so in practical terms, we would certainly enter a discussion, but, we would ultimately deliver specific "paid-for" requirements through bespoke development wherever possible, and would not allow the "being paid for features" to drive or impact our general strategic or committed roadmap.  The one exception to this might be, during such bespoke development engagements we may see opportunities to improve the generic nature of the platform/applications and the customiziability in the generic sense, and to aid bespoke development we may well prioritize those product changes as part of this type of bespoke development. 

__I don't have time to use the Hornbill Forums, I just want to log a call with Hornbill or ask my account manager for a feature request?__
> If you do either of these things your will be redirectd to the forum.  I would refer to the section [Work With Us](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#things-you-can-do-to-improve-the-chances-of-getting-your-feature-request-included) above.  Because of the complexity involved in translating customer requirements into product function, its unreasonable to expect a Hornbill Account Manager or Customer Support Exec and act as a '''man-in-the-middle''' in this process.  We purposefull do not have ANY internal systems that allows anyone to "Log a Feature Request", instead we encourage all feature requests to originate from a documented conversation, which in almost all cases means, a meaningful and documented discussion that leads to confirmation from Hornbill's product team that we have a clear and definitive understanding of what is being asked for.  This is our process, and the only process we follow for customer-requested product enhancement requests.
