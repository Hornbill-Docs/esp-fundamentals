# Hornbill Roadmap

Hornbill encompasses a complex ecosystem involving various components, including the core platform, integration libraries for cloud and IT operations, and a range of business applications available in the Hornbill App Store. The platform, as well as each of these application are developed by dedicated teams, ensuring the right subject matter expertise is applied to each application. This decentralized approach to development ensures that each component can evolve independently.

Creating a unified roadmap for the entire Hornbill ecosystem would be impractical. Such a document would amalgamate the development timelines and updates of the platform itself, the cloud and IT operational integration libraries, the IT Operations Management (ITOM) integrations, the ITOM product suite, and the individual applications offered in the App Store. Given the distinct development cycles, team responsibilities, and the detailed nature of updates each component undergoes, a single roadmap would become overly complex and challenging to navigate for all stakeholders.

To address this complexity, Hornbill has adopted a more granular approach to its roadmap publications. By organizing the roadmaps by product, Hornbill ensures that information is accessible and understandable, with each product/application roadmap having specific focus.  Customers can easily find specific roadmaps relevant to their interests or usage within the ecosystem. This organization aids in setting clear expectations regarding new features, updates, and enhancements for each component/application of the Hornbill platform.

Customers can access these published roadmaps within the Hornbill platform itself, in the Hornbill Solution Center. Hornbill offers this transparency to foster a deeper understanding of our commitment to innovation and customer support, ensuring users can anticipate changes and plan accordingly.

**To access the roadmaps:**
1. Open Configuration using the cog at the bottom of the left-hand menu bar (or with CTRL+SHIFT+S on your keyboard).
1. Click the down arrow next to *My Personal Settings*, then select **Hornbill Solution Center**.
1. Scroll down and click **Roadmap Library**.

## Roadmaps

Each roadmap is presented as a visual Kanban-inspired board organized into columns containing features. Each column represents a different stage of development of the feature.

## Roadmap timelines for feature development
After asking for a roadmap, the next question is almost always "When will I get the things I asked for?" As is the case for any software company, there is no simple answer to that question. The official position is that we never apply --- and we advise our customers __NOT__ to expect --- any service-level commitments on feature/enhancement requests. Of course, with our *Customer First* value held close to our hearts, we do our best to include as much, and develop as quickly, as we can. Hornbill is a broadly scoped solution, with complex and deep capabilities serving a wide range of our collective customer's needs.  

Technology and security landscapes are moving targets that we have to continuously adapt to. We have strategic, commercial, and competitive imperatives that we must meet, security posture evolution, and continuous improvements in terms of reliability and scalability. As well as all of those considerations, we also focus on delivering as much as we can to support individual customer needs.   

Times between releases can be anything from days to months, depending on what we are doing, although we aim to keep release cycles for each product and application as small as possible. Once a week is a typical release cadence we prefer. So, the answer to the question, how long does it take to get my feature in the product is really "as soon as we can, given all of our other priorities". Ultimately, if you have a business-critical need for something that is not in the product, then you should speak to us and we *might* be able to help, but in all honestly, we do not allow individual customer needs re-prioritize our roadmaps because it would be irresponsible and unfair on other customers to do so. So we are likely to respond with something along the lines of "in that case, perhaps Hornbill is not fit for purpose for your needs at this time". 

## Roadmap Inclusion Policy

### Purpose
This Roadmap Inclusion Policy outlines the criteria, processes, and guidelines for including features, enhancements, and significant bug fixes in our product roadmaps. Our aim is to ensure a transparent, collaborative, and strategic approach to product development that aligns with our company’s vision, customer needs, and market trends.

### Scope
This policy applies to all products and services developed and maintained by our company. It covers the inclusion of new features, enhancements to existing features, and significant bug fixes in the product roadmaps.

### Criteria for inclusion
1. __Strategic alignment.__ The proposed item must align with the overall strategic goals of the company and the product’s vision.
1. __Customer value/impact.__ The item should have a demonstrable impact on improving customers' general satisfaction, solving customers' pain points, or delivering value, determined in the context of customers collectively, not individually.
1. __Non-prescriptive.__ The item should not prescribe a specific function but should instead be expressed as a product enhancement/addition in terms of business value. 
1. __Market trends.__ Consideration is given to emerging market trends and technologies that could enhance the value we deliver to our customers and give us a competitive edge.
1. __Feasibility.__ We will assess the technical, resource, and time feasibility of implementing the proposed item in the context of the overall solution.
1. __Regulatory and compliance needs.__ We will ensure the product complies with relevant laws, regulations, and standards required by our customers as well as our own quality standards.
1. __Security and privacy.__ We will consider enhancements that improve the security and privacy posture of our product.


### Process for inclusion
1. __Starting with a discussion.__ One of the most important steps to adding an item to our roadmap is getting to the point of complete understanding of the requirement. ensuring that requirement is fully aligned with our roadmap, general direction, and Criteria for Inclusion. Internally originated items that are included in the roadmap for development would come out of numerous internal conversations, meetings, working groups as well as furthering our strategic and maturity needs.  For external enhancement requests, we have a very specific process we follow... please see [Requesting features and enhancements](/hornbill-customer-services/request-features).
1. __Review and prioritization.__ The Product Management team will review submissions based on the above criteria. Items will be prioritized based on strategic importance, customer impact, and resource availability.
1. __Stakeholder feedback.__ Shortlisted items will be shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback and further validation.
1. __Approval and scheduling.__ The Product Steering Committee will make final decisions on the inclusion and scheduling of roadmap items.
1. __Communication.__ Approved roadmap items will be communicated to all stakeholders, including teams and customers, through appropriate channels, adding these items where needed to the __Incoming__ lane in the appropriate roadmap. 


### Updating Hornbill roadmaps
Roadmaps are dynamic documents that will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect progress, changing priorities, and new insights. You can view our published roadmaps at any time to see the latest development activity that applies. 

### Feedback and suggestions
We encourage feedback and suggestions from all stakeholders to continuously improve our roadmap planning and execution process. Internal stakeholders will always use our internal workspaces, while customers should always use our community forums to submit feedback, suggestions, ideas, and questions about product enhancements.

### Governance
This policy is governed by the Product Management team and is subject to periodic review and updates to ensure it remains relevant and effective in guiding our roadmap planning and development processes.



## FAQs

__I have asked for something to be added to the product on the forum and I have not had any response from Hornbill.__
> We do not commit to any specific service-level agreements for product enhancement requests. Please know that even if you do not get a response, by asking the question you will have raised awareness of your requirement internally at Hornbill. Try to follow the guidance above to improve the likelihood of getting a response and/or getting your ask included. If your issue remains unanswered and you feel it is business critical, then please talk to your account manager; we may need to recognize that Hornbill is not able to meet your specific business needs at this time. 

__Why is there no movement in the roadmap items?__
> The latest roadmap for respective products is distributed to your instance each time the product or application is released to the 'live' stream. It is possible for the delivery of features to be one release out of sync, simply to do with a combination of timing and general roadmap content management. The roadmap provides insight as to what's coming, and what's already been delivered. The timestamps on the card indicate the date/time the card makes it into its current lane.

__I noticed that a card not seen before appeared in the Complete column.__
> This can happen when a request doesn't start on the left-most lane. It is common that, as we are developing our strategic roadmap or addressing usability issues, security issues, or other unplanned changes, that encounter items that we consider "__roadmap noteworthy__". In such cases, we will add a card to the roadmap, implement it, and move it to Complete before the next release of that product/application. What want all "__roadmap noteworthy__" changes to make it into the Complete column so you can see what has been delivered.  

__As a significant Hornbill client, we've encountered a critical business need that isn't currently addressed by Hornbill. Is it possible to adapt the product to meet this requirement?__
> At Hornbill, we value feedback and the needs of all our customers, regardless of size. We strive to balance individual requests with the overall strategic direction and benefit to our entire customer base. While we carefully consider every request, including those from our larger clients, our commitment is to ensure that any modifications or enhancements we make to our product are in the best interest of all our users. We're always keen to explore how we can meet your business-critical needs and invite you to share your requirements with us. Together, we can discuss potential solutions or workarounds that align with our product roadmap and serve the wider Hornbill community.

__If our organization is open to funding specific development of product features, can Hornbill accommodate tailored development of product features to meet our specific/urgent needs?__
> At Hornbill, we're dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and are open to discussions about how we can support your unique business requirements. While we primarily focus on delivering features that benefit all our customers and align with our strategic roadmap, we do offer bespoke development and consulting services. These services are designed to address your specific needs either directly through Hornbill or via our extensive partner network. Our aim is to find the best solution that aligns with your goals without deviating from our core product strategy. In cases where bespoke development can contribute to the broader utility and customizability of our platform, we might integrate such enhancements into our product. This approach ensures that we continue to evolve Hornbill in a way that benefits all users while addressing specific customer needs through tailored solutions.

__I'm quite busy and don't have the time to participate in the Hornbill user community. Is it possible to contact my Hornbill account manager to submit a feature request instead?__
> We understand that your time is valuable, and we aim to make our support and feature request processes as efficient as possible. For feature requests, we encourage using the Hornbill Forums. This approach ensures that your ideas are openly discussed and thoroughly evaluated by both the community and our product teams. Direct requests to account managers or through support tickets are redirected to the forums to ensure transparency and to foster community engagement. This method helps us in gathering comprehensive details and understanding the context of each request accurately. We've found that this collaborative approach significantly enhances our ability to make informed decisions about product development. For guidance on effectively submitting a feature request and increasing its chances for inclusion, please see [Requesting features and enhancements](/hornbill-customer-services/request-features). Our goal is to maintain a clear and open channel of communication with our users, ensuring that every suggestion is considered with the attention it deserves.

__Why do roadmap items in the Complete column not show which release each item is associated with?__
> Our roadmap is designed to showcase the progress of engineering tasks, both ongoing and completed. Due to the nature of our release process, which is carefully structured through a four-stage pipeline, it's challenging to assign a fixed release number to each completed item immediately. This is because any given build in our pipeline might be delayed or revised if it encounters testing or validation issues. Such delays can vary, affecting when a completed item is officially released. To find out precisely which features or updates have been included in a specific build or version, the best resource is our product release notes. These notes (also available in our Solution Center) are meticulously updated to include details on the features, changes, and fixes in each build. They serve as a comprehensive guide to what's new and improved in every version of our product, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date information. We understand how important it is for you to stay informed about the latest developments and enhancements to our product. That's why we're committed to providing clear, detailed release notes alongside our roadmap, helping you navigate and make the most of our evolving solutions.
