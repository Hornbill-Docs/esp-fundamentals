# Hornbill Roadmap

Hornbill encompasses a complex ecosystem involving various components, including the core platform, integration libraries for cloud and IT operations, and a range of business applications available in the Hornbill App Store. The platform, as well as each of these application are developed/maintained by dedicated teams, ensuring the right subject matter expertise is applied to each application. This decentralized approach to development ensures that each component can evolve independently.

Creating a unified roadmap for the entire Hornbill ecosystem would be impractical. Such a document would amalgamate the development timelines and updates of the platform itself, the cloud and IT operational integration libraries, the IT Operations Management (ITOM) integrations, the ITOM product suite, and the individual applications offered in the App Store. Given the distinct development cycles, team responsibilities, and the detailed nature of updates each component undergoes, a singular roadmap would likely become overly complex and challenging to navigate for stakeholders (both internal and for our customers).

To address this complexity, Hornbill has adopted a more granular approach to its roadmap publications. By organizing the roadmaps by product, Hornbill ensures that information is accessible and understandable, with each product/application roadmap having specific focus.  Customers can easily find specific roadmaps relevant to their interests or usage within the ecosystem. This organization aids in setting clear expectations regarding new features, updates, and enhancements for each component/application of the Hornbill platform.

For customers, accessing these published roadmaps is made easy within the Hornbill platform itself. The Hornbill Solution Center serves as a hub where customers can navigate to the "Subscription" section and then to the "Roadmap Library." This library offers an organized collection of roadmaps, allowing customers to stay informed about the developmental trajectory of the components they utilize. This transparency fosters a deeper understanding of Hornbill's commitment to innovation and customer support, ensuring users can anticipate changes and plan accordingly.

## Roadmaps

Each roadmap is presented as a visual Kanban-inspired board containing a fixed set of columns, each column has a specific meaning, allowing you to understand what features and changes are accepted for development, and in what stage of development each feature is at.

## Roadmap Timelines for Feature Development
Outside of being generally asked for "a roadmap" this question is almost always followed by a question seeking timelines in order to answer to the "when will I get the things I asked for?" and as is the case for almost every serious software company, there is never a simple answer to that question.  The official position is, we never apply, and advise our customers __NOT__ to expect any service-level commitments on product feature/enhancement requests.  Of course, with our Customer-First value held close to our hearts, we do our best to include as much, and as quickly as we  can.  Hornbill is a broadly scoped solution, with complex and deep capabilities serving a wide range of our collective customer's needs.  

Technology and Security landscapes are moving targets that we have to continuously adapt to, we have strategic, commercial and competitive imperatives that we must meet, security posture evolution and continuous improvements in terms of reliability and scalability. As well as all of those considerations, we also focus on delivering as much as we can to support individual customer needs too.   

Times between releases can be anything from days to months, depending on what we are doing, although we aim to keep release cycles for each product and applications as small as possible, once a week is a typical release cadence we prefer.  So, the answer to the question, how long does it take to get my feature in the product is really "as soon as we can, given all of our other priorities".  Ultimately, if you have a "business critical" need for something that is not in the product, then you should speak to us and we *might* be able to help, but in all honestly, we do not allow individual customer needs re-prioritize our roadmaps because it would be irresponsible and unfair on other customers to do so, so we are likely to respond with something along the lines of "in that case, perhaps Hornbill is not fit for purpose for your needs at this time". 

## Roadmap Inclusion Policy

### Purpose
This Roadmap Inclusion Policy outlines the criteria, processes, and guidelines for including features, enhancements, and significant bug fixes in our product roadmaps. Our aim is to ensure a transparent, collaborative, and strategic approach to product development that aligns with our company’s vision, customer needs, and market trends.

### Scope
This policy applies to all products and services developed and maintained by our company. It covers the inclusion of new features, enhancements to existing features, and significant bug fixes in the product roadmaps.

### Criteria for Inclusion
1. __Strategic Alignment:__ The proposed item must align with the overall strategic goals of the company and the product’s vision.
1. __Customer Value/Impact:__ The item should have a demonstrable impact on improving customers general satisfaction, solving customers pain points, or delivering customers value, determined in the context of customers collectively, not individually.
1. __Non-Prescriptive:__ The item should not prescribe a specific function but should instead be expressed as a product enhancement/addition in terms of business value. 
1. __Market Trends:__ Consideration of emerging market trends and technologies that could enhance the value we deliver to our customers and give us a competitive edge.
1. __Feasibility:__ Assessment of the technical, resource, and time feasibility of implementing the proposed item in the context of the overall solution.
1. __Regulatory and Compliance Needs:__ Ensuring the product complies with relevant laws, regulations, and standards required by our customers as well as our own quality standards.
1. __Security and Privacy:__ Enhancements that improve the security and privacy posture of our product.


### Process for Inclusion
1. __Starting with a Discussion:__ One of the most important steps to adding an item to our roadmap is getting to the point of __Complete Understanding__ of the requirement. ensuring that requirement is fully aligned with our roadmap, general direction, and Criteria for Inclusion. Internally originated items that are included in the roadmap for development would come out of numerous internal conversations, meetings, working groups as well as furthering our strategic and maturity needs.  For external enhancement requests, we have a very specific process we follow... please see [Asking for Enhancements To Be Included in the Hornbill Roadmap](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#asking-for-enhancements-to-be-included-in-the-hornbill-roadmap)
1. __Review and Prioritization:__ The Product Management team will review submissions based on the above criteria. Items will be prioritized based on strategic importance, customer impact, and resource availability.
1. __Stakeholder Feedback:__ Shortlisted items will be shared with relevant stakeholders for feedback and further validation.
1. __Approval and Scheduling:__ The Product Steering Committee will make final decisions on the inclusion and scheduling of roadmap items.
1. __Communication:__ Approved roadmap items will be communicated to all stakeholders, including teams and customers, through appropriate channels, adding these items where needed to the __Incoming__ Lane in the appropriate roadmap. 


### Updating Hornbill Roadmaps
Roadmaps are dynamic documents that will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect progress, changing priorities, and new insights.  You can view our published Roadmaps at any time to see the latest development activity that applies. 

### Feedback and Suggestions
We encourage feedback and suggestions from all stakeholders to continuously improve our roadmap planning and execution process. Internal stakeholders will always use our internal workspaces, while customers should always use our community forums to submit feedback, suggestions, ideas and product enhancement related questions.

### Governance
This policy is governed by the Product Management team and is subject to periodic review and updates to ensure it remains relevant and effective in guiding our roadmap planning and development processes.


## Requesting Enhancements or Feature Requests for inclusion in the Hornbill Roadmap
We are always excited to hear about product enhancements or suggestions, the collective wisdom of our customers is a very important source of knowledge, ideas and experience.  To provide the most amount of value to the widest possible audience, we have to carefully manage enhancement and feature requests, ensuring we give each request consideration, not only on its own merit, but in the context of the whole product, its strategic roadmap and our customer community.  

Every customer originated enhancement or feature request starts with a discussion. Sometimes, simple enhancement requests are self-evident, for example, a request for something like "would it be possible to add a keyboard shortcut to invoke the print command" would hardly require a discussion at all.  However, in practice, enhancement requests are rarely that straightforward and tend to be nuanced in some way. Each customer's use of Hornbill is different, because each customers organization has unique (to them) ways of working and using Hornbill to support that work.   Hornbill's products are very customizable, so for the most part, tailoring can be done by a customer to meet their specific needs without product changes being required.

For the avoidance of any doubt, any discussion that leads to an enhancement request would lead to a clear and well documented (in the discussion) definition of what the requirement is, almost certainly summarized by one of Hornbill's product team clarifying what has been understood as the requirement.  This is what would constitute a discussion with clear outcome that leads to a product enhancement request. 

It might be that a particular part of our solution is not customizable at all, or not customizable enough to meet a specific need, or it might be that there is a function that does not even exist, that should, or could be added to make the product more useful/valuable to a customer to help a specific use case.  On our experience, customers will generally (and rightly) think about solving problems or improving efficiency/workflows in the context of their own organization, and more often than not, what makes sense in one context, does not always make sense in another context.

In order for us to clearly understand what is being asked for, this often means getting a more thorough understanding of how a customer's *specific* scenario applies to what is being asked for, and then, once we understand that requirement fully, and the value such a change would add, Hornbill's product team(s) then need to consider that change in the context of our strategic roadmap, overall use case and the generally understood landscape of how our product is used more widely by our customers. 

When asking for a product enhancement, its important not to be prescriptive in your request, rather, what we generally look for is the business use-case. By this we mean, if you just ask for a widget X or function Y, or button Z, or API abc etc, that may well be meaningful and obviously to your own use case, and meet a specific need you have, but we will likely not understand that more broadly, and so are very unlikely to progress that request into an accepted feature request.  We will always seek to understand the business value, so if the business requirement (aka what you are trying to achieve/what business outcome you expect from the product change) is not apparent in the foundation of what you are asking for, then it is very difficult to assess the request against our [Criteria For Inclusion](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#criteria-for-inclusion) and therefore would not be considered/may not be answered or responded to.  

When asking for an enhancement please make sure you first express the enhancement in terms of business need and business outcome, and, if you want to you can also include a suggestion as to specifically what you might change to achieve that. Doing this helps us better understand the need, and opens the possibility that we might be able to suggest an alternative or even better way to achieve the same outcome.

### How we manage feature requests received from Customer's or Partner's
The first thing to say is, outside very exceptional circumstances where it would be inappropriate to do so (for example if there are security concerns or real commercial sensitivity for a specific organization), we *ONLY* accept feature requests via our community forums.  That is, if you would like to see a change to the product, the starting point is to "raise it on the forums".  It is not uncommon for a customer to ask their account exec in an account review meeting for enhancements, but we will always respond with, please ask that question on the forum.   The reason for this is, we simply do not track internal requests for features that have not been committed to a roadmap, in fact we specifically and purposefully do not just log one-liner enhancement requests, simply because doing so simply creates a huge list of one-liner feature requests that no body understands, and essentially ends up being one big undeliverable backlog of items.  

Instead, we take each and every enhancement request as a discussion, this affords us a number of things.

- Our forums are connected to our internal workspaces, so, if you ask a question on, for example, the Hornbill ESP Platform forum, your post will be relayed to an internal Hornbill workspace and *all* developers, product stakeholders, support, consultants and others will most likely get sight of, and be generally aware of the question you have asked. 
- By posting your question on the forum, we now have a connected communication channel between you directly and our internal product folks, allowing anyone in Hornbill that needs to, additional questions, clarifications, suggestions, or even feedback that this is not something we would consider. 
- By posting your question on our public forums, all other customers who have interest in the product you are asking about will also see your question, they may have other ideas, contribution or even offer support for the thing you are asking for. 
- Because we relay these questions into our internal workspaces there is a very good chance this will trigger some internal conversations, and will almost always trigger some kind of response back on the forum, that might be seeking more information, or trying to garner a better understanding of what is being asked for, might include one or more suggestions as to how you might achieve the outcome you want in an alternative way, or could even be a flat, No, we would not add that. 

Sometimes though, you should keep in mind that you may not get any response from Hornbill, we do not offer SLA commitments on enhancement requests, but despite that, if you feel something should be added to the product, you should ask anyway, even if you do not see a response, you are raising awareness of your requirement, of the suggestion and that will be seen by our engineers and product people.  Sometimes ideas and suggestions are really good, but the timing for inclusion is off, it can be as simple as that.  

We will always do our best to respond to every request, but we are not perfect, and things can get missed, when this happens, please feel free to bump it every now and then if you have not seen any response in a couple of weeks or more. 

### Things you can do to improve the chances of getting your feature request included
It is possible to improve the chances of getting a response, and even getting your requested feature included in the product.  These include: -

__Timing:__ For example, if we are doing a lot of, say, email related changes, and you ask for something email related, the email system is currently top-of-mind with the developers so your ask might naturally just drop into that. 

__Specificity:__ The more specific you are, and the easier your request is to get into the head space of the product people/developers at Hornbill, the more likely your request will make it through. We are all bust people, and as we mentioned before, it can be a lot of work/time mentally to translate a requirement for a customer-specific scenario into a viable piece of code.  So if the nature of your ask is very specific and self-evident, then its likely to be easily understood by our developers, will not need *translating* by a business analyst and so on, and when that happens, so long as it meets the other criteria in our [Criteria for Inclusion](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#criteria-for-inclusion) then this is likely to make it quite quickly.

__Generalized:__ The more generalized the function, the more it will deliver against the '''Customer Value/Impact''' for customers in the general, the higher the likelihood for inclusion.  Conversely, if your requirement is highly specific to your organization, but you can meet that need buy asking for a more Generalized customization capability that would help your specific need, and if that more generalized customization capability would be generally useful to customers overall, then that would help move things forwards. 

__Strategic Alignment:__ We are generally moving towards our strategic product goals, primarily driven by the competitive landscape within which we operated, and the aspirations we have in the marketplace.  Anything you ask for that is aligned with those goals are obviously more likely to make it into the product. 

__Work With Us:__ At the heart of our mission is a simple truth: our success is intertwined with yours. When it comes to product improvements, we are committed to understanding your needs deeply and accurately, ensuring that any product updates or enhancements we consider are perfectly aligned with what you require and our products strategic goals. We believe in the power of collaboration; your insights into your business challenges are invaluable to us. After all, you’re the experts in your field, and by sharing your expertise, you help us refine and improve our solutions.  We think of development enhancements requests as a partnership, and we invite you to join us in a collaborative process. The better we understand your needs—through clear communication and engagement—the more effectively we can work together towards implementing solutions that truly meet your requirements. Our engineering and product teams are ready to consider any requirements, but this journey requires mutual effort and understanding of our process. Remember, every step we take towards enhancing our product is driven by a desire to add more value to your business. We’re not just looking for feedback; we’re seeking to learn from your experience, to innovate and evolve in ways that support your success. Engaging with us, sharing your insights, and being open to the collaborative process not only helps us meet your needs more effectively but also ensures that we continue to deliver solutions that empower you and your business. Let’s work together to create something exceptional. 

## FAQs

__I have asked for something to be added to the product on the forum and I have not had any response from Hornbill.__
> We do not commit to any specific service-level agreements for product enhancement requests. Please know that even if you do not get a response, by asking the question you will have raised awareness of your requirement internally at Hornbill. Try to follow the guidance above to improve the likelihood of getting a response and/or getting your ask included. If your issue remains unanswered and you feel it is business critical, then please talk to your account manager; we may need to recognize that Hornbill is not able to meet your specific business needs at this time. 

__Why is there no movement in the roadmap items?__
> The latest roadmap for respective products is distributed to your instance each time the product or application is released to the 'live' stream. It is possible for the delivery of features to be one release out of sync, simply to do with a combination of timing and general roadmap content management. The roadmap provides insight as to what's coming, and what's already been delivered. The timestamps on the card indicate the date/time the card makes it into its current lane.

__I noticed that a card not seen before appeared in the Complete column.__
> This can happen when a request doesn't start on the left-most lane. It is common that, as we are developing our strategic roadmap or addressing usability issues, security issues, or other unplanned changes, that encounter items that we consider "__roadmap noteworthy__". In such cases, we will add a card to the roadmap, implement it, and move it to Complete before the next release of that product/application. What want all "__roadmap noteworthy__" changes to make it into the Complete column so you can see what has been delivered.  

__As a significant Hornbill client, we've encountered a critical business need that isn't currently addressed by Hornbill. Is it possible to adapt the product to meet this requirement?__
> At Hornbill, we value feedback and the needs of all our customers, regardless of size. We strive to balance individual requests with the overall strategic direction and benefit to our entire customer base. While we carefully consider every request, including those from our larger clients, our commitment is to ensure that any modifications or enhancements we make to our product are in the best interest of all our users. We're always keen to explore how we can meet your business-critical needs and invite you to share your requirements with us. Together, we can discuss potential solutions or workarounds that align with our product roadmap and serve the wider Hornbill community.

__If our organization is open to funding specific development of product features, can Hornbill accommodate tailored development of product features to meet our specific/urgent needs?__
> At Hornbill, we're dedicated to meeting our customers' needs and are open to discussions about how we can support your unique business requirements. While we primarily focus on delivering features that benefit all our customers and align with our strategic roadmap, we do offer bespoke development and consulting services. These services are designed to address your specific needs either directly through Hornbill or via our extensive partner network. Our aim is to find the best solution that aligns with your goals without deviating from our core product strategy. In cases where bespoke development can contribute to the broader utility and customizability of our platform, we might integrate such enhancements into our product. This approach ensures that we continue to evolve Hornbill in a way that benefits all users while addressing specific customer needs through tailored solutions.

__I'm quite busy and don't have the time to participate in the Hornbill user community. Is it possible to contact my Hornbill account manager to submit a feature request instead?__
> We understand that your time is valuable, and we aim to make our support and feature request processes as efficient as possible. For feature requests, we encourage using the Hornbill Forums. This approach ensures that your ideas are openly discussed and thoroughly evaluated by both the community and our product teams. Direct requests to account managers or through support tickets are redirected to the forums to ensure transparency and to foster community engagement. This method helps us in gathering comprehensive details and understanding the context of each request accurately. We've found that this collaborative approach significantly enhances our ability to make informed decisions about product development. For guidance on effectively submitting a feature request and increasing its chances for inclusion, please refer to our [Work With Us](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#things-you-can-do-to-improve-the-chances-of-getting-your-feature-request-included) section. Our goal is to maintain a clear and open channel of communication with our users, ensuring that every suggestion is considered with the attention it deserves.

__Why do roadmap items in the Complete column not show which release each item is associated with?__
> Our roadmap is designed to showcase the progress of engineering tasks, both ongoing and completed. Due to the nature of our release process, which is carefully structured through a four-stage pipeline, it's challenging to assign a fixed release number to each completed item immediately. This is because any given build in our pipeline might be delayed or revised if it encounters testing or validation issues. Such delays can vary, affecting when a completed item is officially released. To find out precisely which features or updates have been included in a specific build or version, the best resource is our product release notes. These notes (also available in our Solution Center) are meticulously updated to include details on the features, changes, and fixes in each build. They serve as a comprehensive guide to what's new and improved in every version of our product, ensuring you have the most accurate and up-to-date information. We understand how important it is for you to stay informed about the latest developments and enhancements to our product. That's why we're committed to providing clear, detailed release notes alongside our roadmap, helping you navigate and make the most of our evolving solutions.
