# Activity Streams
An activity stream is a notification mechanism and conversation space. It lists content relevant to its parent entity, be that a user, workspace, request, document or configuration item. A user notionally subscribes to, or “follows” the entity's activity stream to track its related content.

Being a member of a workspace, or following a user, request, document, or organization, will ensure you receive notifications about posts and comments made to the relevant entity's activity stream.
Updates to all your entity activities streams will be served up to you in real-time on your [News Feed](/esp-user-guide/news-feed), giving you one central destination for everything you are interested in.

## Using Activity Streams
### Posts
Add an initial post to start a discussion, encourage collaboration or inform other users who have access to, or are following the activity stream.

When posting to an activity stream, there are many common attributes and options available to you, such as out-of-the-box integrations, [wiki markup](/esp-fundamentals/reference-guides/hornbill-wiki-markup), embedding rich content, and mentioning other users.

### Comments
Much like a post, a user can add content to the activity stream, but in this context, they can do so directly against a post that is already on the activity stream, providing a comment about the post or other comments on the post.

* As with a post, a user can utilize Wiki Markup, embed content, add sentiment and mention other users in the comment they are making
* Comments can be edited or deleted by the user who added them. However, be quick as you can only do this until another user has liked the comment, or added another comment to the post.

### Reply
Use the Reply option in a post or comment if you want to automatically mention the user who wrote the post or comment you are replying to.
* This option will automatically add a mention at the beginning of your comment.
* You can remove the mention, or add more, as with any other usual type of comment.
* Mentions will automatically send a Hornbill notification to the mentioned users when the comment is added.

### Sorting the Order of Posts and Comments
By default, posts and comments are presented in date and time chronological order, and new posts and comments will appear in real-time.

At the top of the activity stream, there is a sort option, which lets each user decide if they want the activity stream content sorted by:
* **Most Recently Posted**. With this option selected, you will always see the last added post at the top of the activity stream.
* **Most Recently Updated**. With this option selected, you will always see the post, with the last updated comment at the top of the activity stream.

### Activity Stream Content Authors and Timestamps
Click on the image of the user in a post or comment to see a pop-up with more information about the user and a link to their profile.
Hover over the post or comment timestamp indicator to see the date and time it was added to the activity stream. Click on the time indicator to open the post in a new browser tab

### Activity Stream Translations
Users may post or comment on an activity stream in their chosen language. If your language does not match, you will see a Translate option underneath any activity stream content that is not in your chosen language. Click the translate link to see the content in your chosen language.

Equally, if a post was made by a user in a different language from your own, you will see a Translate option visible to you when adding comments to the post. This allows you to translate your comment into the language of the post before submitting your comment. Don't worry, this is not essential, and if you forget, all other users will have the option to translate your comments into their language when reviewing the activity stream content.

:::note
Hornbill uses Google's translation service to power this capability.

## Integration
Hornbill is a powerful cloud-based collaboration tool designed to share ideas and information. To make our tool as flexible as possible, we integrate with other cloud-based services to make sharing content, including rich media, easy, seamless and transparent. Generally speaking, integration in this context means being able to understand, embed and communicate with other popular cloud services. The following is a list of the services we have pre-integrated with and that simply work out-of-the-box.
