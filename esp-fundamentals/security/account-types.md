# Login and Account Types
The Hornbill Platform provides the ability for different classes of users to access different areas of the system.  Under the hood, all users are subject to strict security controls, but different classes of user require very different access controls to be applied.  In essence there are three types of "user" that can access the Hornbill platform, these are called `user`, `basic` and `guest`. 

The Hornbill Platform is, at its core, a workflow automation and digital enablement tool, designed to help organizations to digitize and automate workflows. Users of the Hornbill platform are generally considered to be participating in the provision of service to users or customers, or are in receipt of/consume services being provided.

In broad terms, there are two categories of users.  The first category are users who are involved in the day-to-day work of providing service to others, we refer to these as service providers.  These types of users typically use Hornbill on a day to day basis to facilitate providing service to either Employees or Customers who will also interact with the Hornbill Platform. 

The second category of users are employees and/or customers, who are typically individuals, although can be organizations, who are the recipients, or consumers of the service(s) being provided, including the consumption of services through various types of self-service portals, integrations or automation's.  Often, a Hornbill Service Provider User can also be a Service Consumer, this is fairly typical use case in terms of Enterprise Service Management for Employees. 

|Account Type|Service Type|Description|
|:---|---|---|
|`system`|n/a|System accounts are special internal accounts that enable the system to function. These accounts are allocated allocated by the system and cannot be changed/edited/deleted. System accounts are also inaccessible for logins of any type or other uses.|
|`user`|_see below_|A user account is any individual person or system that has a dedicated account on the Hornbill Platform that can be logged into to gain access to the Hornbill Platform facilities and functions.  The purpose of an "account" on the Hornbill Platform is to act as a security container for interaction with the systems functions. In other words, the **only** way you can get access to any part of the system is _through_ a defined account,  There are three sub-categories of users, those being `full`,  `basic` and `portal` (see below for description)
|`user/full`|Service Provider<br><br>Consumer|This is the user type that would log into Hornbill and use it on a day to day basis as a tool and management system that enables them to provide/deliver the services being provided to others. When we talk about a `subscriber` to Hornbill, they are classed generally as a __user__ of the system. In a typical ESM setting, full users are also Consumers of services being provided|
|`user/basic`|Consumer|This type of user account is equivalent to a normal 'user' account, but, with very reduced access to the features of the system.  A `basic` user can easily be promoted to a `full` user, and visa versa, the fundamental difference between a `full` user and a `basic` user is, a full user requires a subscription to use the main features of the Hornbill Platform and its applications, while a basic user does not require a specific subscription but only gets very limited access to the systems functionality. 
|`user/portal`|Consumer|This is a special system account that cannot be logged into directly. This account type provides security access control to guests logging into, or accessingHornbill via a guest portal.  When accessing the Hornbill Platform via one of its guest portals or mobile applications, all guest logins get the same basic security controls applied to their session, that are defined by the portal account|
|`guest`|Consumer|A guest user is another class of person that may log in, or otherwise access Hornbill through a guest portal or system. Guests are considered Service Consumers, and therefore have very limited access to the Hornbill Platform features. Typically, guests are individual users who are external to the organization, for example, customers, consumers, citizens etc.  There are two sub-categories of guest accounts, being 'anonymous' or 'authenticated'. See descriptions below |
|`guest/anonymous`|Consumer|This type of guest is a person interacting with the Hornbill platform, typically through a portal or integration of some sort, were the user is unknown to, and unauthenticated on the Hornbill Platform.  The most basic example of this this is when a guest who needs to access the customer self-service portal enters the URL and is greeted with the Login Page.  At this point, without logging in, that user may, for example have very limited access to some knowledge or FAQ's or other basic functions that do not require a login in order to access. These interactions are know to the system as access by an `anonymous` guest|
|`guest/authenticated`|Consumer|In the context of the guest portal, an authenticated guest is an individual who has successfully identified themselves as a known individual, typically this means they have a record in the Hornbill '''Contacts''' database and have authenticated/registered against that contact record.|
