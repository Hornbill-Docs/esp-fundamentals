# KeySafe
The Hornbill platform includes a feature called KeySafe. The purpose of the KeySafe is to provide a safe and secure way of storing credentials, API keys and other security-sensitive information that needs to be available at the point of use, when making API/Integration calls to other systems.  

In more typical integration approaches, credentials used in integrations are often kept in plain text file, on a server, relying on the local administration of the server its self to secure that information.  Because the Hornbill Platform is a cloud based service, we needed to create a way of safely and securely storing credentials, API keys, certificates and other sensitive information that ensured that this information is encrypted at rest and in motion and only used at the very point of use.
