# Text Assist (AI Assist)

In Hornbill there are numerous places you might be writing textual content.  AI Assist is a productivity feature powered by OpenAI that brings generative AI capabilities to your fingertips to help with improving on or expanding your written content, as well as providing you access to non-company-specific generalized knowledge.  These features enhance your ability to write with great clarity, expand on common topics where required and access generic knowledge available to the underlying language model.

AI Assist is in the early stages of development as we consider, observe and better understand how customers make use of this as well as how we might further use Generative AI to enhance the user experience and productivity when using Hornbill.

#### Can we get any technical documentation and any other statements that Hornbill might have prepared to allay any of the numerous concerns of these types?
> This is in the very early stages of development, today is very simple and does not warrant any significant documentation in its own right, its just a nicely done integration to an existing AI GenAI service. We are still deciding on exactly how this applies and will be used in the long term, we have limited internal technical documentation that would be customer-friendly, so at this time we do not. We would refer you to the [OpenAI API]( https://openai.com/product) documentation which will give you a lot more insight into how the GenAI system works.

#### Does the feature offer insight into any of our Business-Specific process models and offer our users insight into how we can better use the Hornbill product?
> No not at this time, its purely there as an assistive tool to help with generalized writing, grammar and general/generic knowledge access
