# Text Assist (HAi Assist)

In Hornbill there are numerous places you may be writing textual content.  HAi Assist is a productivity feature that brings generative AI capabilities to your fingertips to help with improving or expanding your written content, as well as providing you access to non-company-specific generalized AI knowledge.  These features enhance your users ability to write with great clarity, expand on common topics where required and access generic knowledge available to the underlying AI language models.

HAi Assist is in the early stages of development as we consider, observe and better understand how customers make use of this as well as how we might further use Generative AI technologies to enhance the user experience and productivity when using Hornbill.
