# Browser compatibility

To ensure optimal security and best functionality/performance, always keep your web browser updated. Most modern browsers are designed to update automatically, but you should verify that auto-updates are enabled. Additionally, some browsers receive updates through your operating system's update service, so it's crucial to install these updates promptly when they become available.

Different browsers offer different features, and performance may vary depending on the browser and operating system you are working with.  Always use the most recent versions of the following browsers for the best experience with Hornbill.
