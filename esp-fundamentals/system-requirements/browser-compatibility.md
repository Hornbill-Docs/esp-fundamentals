# Browser Compatibility

To ensure optimal security and functionality, always keep your web browser updated. Most modern browsers are designed to update automatically, but you should verify that auto-updates are enabled. Additionally, some browsers receive updates through your operating system's update service, so it's crucial to install these updates promptly when they become available.
