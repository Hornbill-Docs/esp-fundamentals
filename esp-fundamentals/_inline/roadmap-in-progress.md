title: In Progress
------------
Items in this lane are under active development, that means one or more developers is working on code, integration, testing and iterative cycles of the same. This generally means items here, are likely on beta instances, and are in some form or another in the product (pre-customer release) and under active development.  Sometimes its possible for items to remain in this lane while we make the feature available to customers in "Preview". Features in preview generally means, a feature has been developed and is made generally available for customers to try out, typically by enabling through a feature flag/option/preview button.  For some changes, especially those that involve significant UI changes that will likely impact (we always hope for the better of course) customers day-to-day use and/or workflows, we like to provide early access, to solicit feedback and suggestions that may help improve the change before we finally commit to production.
