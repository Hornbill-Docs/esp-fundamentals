title: Incoming
------------
Items in this lane mean the enhancement/change has been fully understood (by Hornbill dev teams), has been documented, and is ready for inclusion in active development. But is not yet under active development, in effect these items are the pipeline of changes for the development teams. Generally speaking, it takes quite a lot of effort around any feature request before it is ready to be added to the roadmap (see Getting Enhancements Added to a Hornbill Roadmap below). There is no specific time associated to when an item in this lane will be moved to the 90-Day Commit lane, this is dependant on a large number of factors discussed in the section Roadmap Inclusion Policy below.
