Items in this lane are under active development. This means one or more developers are working on code, integration, testing, and iterative cycles of the same. In general, items here are likely on beta instances, are in some form or another in the product (pre-customer release), and are under active development. Sometimes it is possible for items to remain in this lane while we make the feature available to customers in *preview*. Being in preview means that a feature has been developed and is made generally available for customers to try out, typically by enabling it through a feature flag/option/preview button. For some changes, especially those that involve significant UI changes that will likely impact customers' day-to-day use and/or workflows, we like to provide early access; this allows us to solicit feedback and suggestions that may help improve the change before we finally commit it to production.
