Any item in this lane means the item is in the Hornbill development team's planning window. Beyond scheduling, other things that happen in these 90 days include development team discussions, adding detail to design specifications, and development of prototypes. However, as the title of this lane suggests, what we are committing to is getting actual development work underway within 90 days of the item entering this lane.
