Items in this lane mean the enhancement/change has been fully understood (by Hornbill dev teams), has been documented, and is ready for inclusion in active development. These items are not yet under active development. In effect, these items are the pipeline of changes for the development teams. It takes quite a lot of effort around any feature request before it is ready to be added to the roadmap (see [Requesting enhancements or features for inclusion in the Hornbill Roadmap](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#requesting-enhancements-or-features-for-inclusion-in-the-hornbill-roadmaps)). There is no specific time assigned for when an item in this lane will be moved to the 90-Day Commit lane; timing is dependent on numerous factors discussed in the [Roadmap Inclusion Policy](/esp-fundamentals/about/about-roadmap#roadmap-inclusion-policy).
