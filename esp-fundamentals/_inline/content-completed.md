Items in this lane means the work has been completed by development and is now in the product.  Items are kept in this lane for 90-days after completion, after which they drop out of the lane automatically.  You should always remember that, depending on the roadmap you are looking at, items in this lane shown as complete *may* have other dependencies, or require other applications or components to surface this capability. For example, we may implement a feature in the Hornbill ESP Platform that enables an application to implement something, for example, we may add a feature to Email templates editor, but in order for you to see this feature, another application may also need to make changes. Generally speaking we do not include "internal" items on customer facing roadmaps in order to keep customer-facing roadmaps meaningful, but its sometimes unavoidable that these things can bleed through from time to time.
